## Projects
### Encrypted Messaging Software In A Network Environment Using Playfair Cipher With Turkish Alphabet
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/serdestonat/playfair-crypted-text-software)

The objective of this project is to create a messaging software that encrypts messages in the server and decrypts them in the client, using **Python**. Since it is a Turkish version of a Playfair Cipher, we needed to make adjustments of our own. For example, a regular Playfair Cipher is a 5x5 matrix wheras our matrix is a 6x6 due to fact that Turkish alphabet is a 29 letter alphabet and the remaining 7 spots of that 6x6 matrix are filled with various punctuation marks such as "." , "," "!", "?" etc.


### A Functional E-Commerce Website

Used **Next.JS** to make a functioning e-commerce website using REST API. This website can add items to cart, delete them from the cart and you can decide the quantity of items. Categories and items are pulled from an API. You can search items from a search bar with an incluison of a "Scroll To Top" button. But since the API is public the items and categories may change and not shown properly from time to time.
